# How to run the program:
Use test_chess.py or gui_chess.py to see the AIs in action. The most sophisticated bots are the AlphaBetaAI and the 
IterativeDeepeningAI. To run either, input the desired depth you want the AI to run minimax to, and also input the
color that the AI is playing for (input true for white and false if you want the AI to play black). You can play the AI
using HumanPlayer() in test_chess.py, and gui_chess.py is best used to watch the bots play each other.
