# BethHermbot
A chess AI designed by Tucker Simpson and Harry Irwin.

## How to run the program:
Use test_chess.py or gui_chess.py to see the AIs in action. The most sophisticated bots are the AlphaBetaAIv2 and the 
IterativeDeepeningAIv2. To run either, input the desired depth you want the AI to run minimax to, and also input the
color that the AI is playing for (input true for white and false if you want the AI to play black). You can play against
the AI using HumanPlayer() in test_chess.py, and gui_chess.py is best used to watch the bots play each other.
